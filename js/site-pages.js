Right to Access, Correct and Delete Data and to Object to Data Processing Our customers have the right to access, correct and delete personal data relating to them, and to object to the processing of such data, by addressing a written request, at any time. The Company makes every effort to put in place suitable precautions to safeguard the security and privacy of personal data, and to prevent it from being altered, corrupted, destroyed or accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, the Company does not control each and every risk related to the use of the Internet, and therefore warns the Site users of the potential risks involved in the functioning and use of the Internet.

Management of Personal Data You can view or edit your personal data online for many of our services. You can also make choices about our collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which services you use. You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from our web site by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message.

These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain web site services. Information We Collect Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location. The data we collect depends on the services and features you use. How We Use Your Information Our web site uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our business and provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, to send communications, including promotional communications, and to display advertising. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various web site services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number. Sharing Your Information We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so.

In addition, we share personal data among our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we\'ve hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets. privacy@goddesssalsa.com Gallery Quick Links Our Team Shop Pricing FAQ Contact Us What We Offer Our Blog Testimonials Cooking School Get in touch 1885 Somerset Dr., Glendale Heights, IL 60139 USA +1 (773) 366 4220 smggraf91@yahoo.com Â© 2020.

While you can accent the grilled meat with a sauce made with more herbs and garlic, plus capers and anchovies; I like to make mine using our <a href="https://goddess-salsas.github.io/single-product.html?id=4">Zorya Salsa Verde</a.  I find that the combination of citrus notes and heat help make an amazing steak.\n\n <b>Step 1</b>\nIn a small bowl, combine the parsley, rosemary, thyme, garlic and olive oil. Spread the mixture all over the steak. Cover and refrigerate on a platter for at least 4 hours or overnight.\n\n<b>Step 2</b>    \nLight a grill. Scrape most of the marinade off the steak and season the meat with salt and black pepper. Grill over high heat for about 3 minutes. Turn the steak and grill for 2 minutes longer, until browned outside and medium-rare within. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Thinly slice the steak against the grain and sprinkle with smoked paprika. Pass the salsa verde at the table.\n\n'

For the seasonings; you can also use a store-bought or homemade taco seasoning mix. \n<b>Step 5</b>  Cover the bottom of a baking dish with salsa. Arrange chicken on top and add more salsa over each chicken breast.\n<b>Step 6</b> Bake for 30 minutes, or until chicken is done.\n<b>Step 7</b> Add shredded cheese on top and bake for 4 more minutes, or until cheese is melted.\nThat is it!
