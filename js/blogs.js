        description: 'Skirt steak, nicely marbled with fat, takes well to marinades, like this simple mix of herbs and garlic. While you can accent the grilled meat with a sauce made with more herbs and garlic, plus capers and anchovies; I like to make mine using our <a href="https://goddess-salsas.github.io/single-product.html?id=4">Zorya Salsa Verde</a.  I find that the combination of citrus notes and heat help make an amazing steak.\n\n',
        content: '<b>Step 1</b>\nIn a small bowl, combine the parsley, rosemary, thyme, garlic and olive oil. Spread the mixture all over the steak. Cover and refrigerate on a platter for at least 4 hours or overnight.\n\n<b>Step 2</b>    \nLight a grill. Scrape most of the marinade off the steak and season the meat with salt and black pepper. Grill over high heat for about 3 minutes. Turn the steak and grill for 2 minutes longer, until browned outside and medium-rare within. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Thinly slice the steak against the grain and sprinkle with smoked paprika. Pass the salsa verde at the table.\n\n',

        content: `Incredibly simple and SO easy to make, this Baked Salsa Chicken is always the perfect recipe for when you’re short on time, but still want a delicious, homemade dinner.
This easy recipe needs just a few ingredients and it’s a snap to prepare.
<b>Step 1</b> The first and hardest step is to choose which Goddess Salsa you want to use for your chicken.  Our Salsas range across flavor profiles - from mild to hot; but, I generally prefer either Aphrodite, Ostara, or Pachamama for family dinners.
<b>Step 2</b> Preheat oven to 375 F
<b>Step 3</b> Warm some olive oil in a skillet.
<b>Step 4</b>  Season chicken breasts with a mixture of seasonings, herbs, salt, and pepper; transfer chicken to skillet and cook for 2 minutes per side, or until just browned. For the seasonings; you can also use a store-bought or homemade taco seasoning mix. 
<b>Step 5</b>  Cover the bottom of a baking dish with salsa. Arrange chicken on top and add more salsa over each chicken breast.
<b>Step 6</b> Bake for 30 minutes, or until chicken is done.
<b>Step 7</b> Add shredded cheese on top and bake for 4 more minutes, or until cheese is melted.
That's it! Let stand 5 minutes, then serve.`,
